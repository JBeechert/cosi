Collection of scripts I've written for COSI 

July 21, 2022:
I decided to collect a variety of scripts I've written for COSI calibration, analysis, etc. 

These are generally python scripts which I've writted to accomplish a variety of tasks and have relied on throughout my time with COSI. The order in which they are committed to this repository is not indicative of their importance. 

Some of scripts are unfinished; there are several projects which I toyed around with but never quite completed. Works in progress, if you will, for a rainy day.

### Disclaimer: I do not claim that these scripts are without error. There is always room for improvement.
